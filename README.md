# Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Visual Knowledge Enhancement Framework for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tailored to address Construction Occupational Health and Safety (COHS) hazards through Visual Question Answering (VQA) .

# Performance Highlights
| Question type | Metric | Improevment vs baseline |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Binary classification quesstion | Recall ↑ | +95.28% |
| Counting question | Accuracy ↑ | +194.13% |
| Open-ended question | Recall ↑ | +156.23% |

These results highlight the transformative potential of our framework in enhancing safety monitoring of MLLMs at construction sites.
# COHSD
In view of the absence of the relevant dataset, this study establishes the first construction industry-oriented visual benchmark dataset for COHS, termed COHSD, so as to systematically validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. COHSD is sourced from three categories: 1) site images containing COHS hazards collected from 12 Chinese construction projects; 2) construction images containing COHS hazards downloaded and filtered from the web; 3) a large-scale image dataset, Site Object Detection Dataset (SODA), specifically compiled and annotated for construction sites. COHSD comprises a total of 226 construction images, among which 53 images are classified as safe, and 173 images contain COHS hazards. The COHS hazard-containing images are categorized into two main types: construction objects and operations, comprehensively covering the predefined 15 types of construction objects and 20 types of operational scenarios.
